# Tensorflow Tutorials
This repository contains the notebooks I used to follow the tensorflow tutorials found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials).
## Quickstart
Basic setup for training and evaluating the accuracy of a neural network.
## Fashion MNIST
I train a neural network on the Fashion MNIST dataset to predict what type of article of clothing is in an image.
## Text Classification
I use tensorflow hub and keras to perform binary classification on movie reviews. Based on the text of the review, it will be classified as a positive or negative review.
